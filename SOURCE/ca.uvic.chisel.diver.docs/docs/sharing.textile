h1. Sharing Your Traces

Diver now offers ways for you to keep a record of your traces, and share them with other people. This can be done
in two main ways: by exporting screenshots of your sequence diagrams; and by exporting and importing entire
traces.

h2. Exporting Screenshots

Diver makes it easy to export screenshots of your sequence diagrams. Just look for the little camera 
(!../images/sharing/screenshoticon.png!) icon. You can find it on the sequence diagram's toolbar, drop-down menu,
or pop-up menu:

!../images/sharing/screenshot1.png!
 
Selecting it will give you a standard file/save dialog. You can export the image as a bmp, png, or jpeg file. When you
export the diagram, you will have a full-sized picture of the diagram exactly as it appears in the main pain of the
viewer:

!../images/sharing/screenshot2.png!

h2. Exporting Traces

Diver also makes it possible to export and import entire traces. You can do so by using the standard import/export
wizards under the category  _Diver_, or by using the shortcut in the _Program Traces_ view:

!../images/sharing/export1.png!

The Diver export wizard will present you with a page that allows you to select the trace to export, and the threads
to export within that trace. By default, the exported traces will exclude any threads that do not contain activations
("empty threads"). You can change this by unselecting the check box at the bottom of the page. You will also need 
to select a file to save the trace into. The file extension is _dvt_, which stands for "<u>D</u>i<u>v</u>er <u>t</u>race file".*

That is all you need to know to export traces. Now, all you need is a way to import them.

h2. Importing Traces

Importing traces in Diver is very similar to running or analyzing traces. Just open the _Import Trace_ wizard:

!../images/sharing/import1.png!

Then, use the file browser to select a Diver trace file:
  
 !../images/sharing/import2.png!
 
Once a file has been set, the import wizard will automatically scan that file to make sure that it is a valid Diver trace
file. Then, import the trace just as if you were using the _Reanalyze Trace_ wizard (see <a href="#GainingADifferentPerspective">Gaining
A Different Perspective</a> for more information).

Once you select _Finish_, the trace will be copied into Diver's trace storage, and the files will be analyzed. You will
see the newly imported trace in your _Program Traces_ view.  



*Diver trace files, much like Java jar files, are simply files compressed in the ZIP format. If you are really interested
in seeing what is in the trace file, you can reset the extension to _zip_, and explore the file.
